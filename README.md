How do I approach designing software?
Start by fully understanding the problem you're trying to solve. Engage in research, user interviews, and explore similar software solutions to gain insights. 
Gather both functional and non-functional requirements. Clearly outline what the software should do, how it should perform, and any constraints.
Regularly review the design with stakeholders and iterate based on feedback. This ensures the design aligns with user needs and technical feasibility.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Improved ability to design 3D models, mesh structures, and shaders. Enhanced skills in creating intuitive navigation and control systems for 3D environments.
trengthened understanding of how to structure complex systems involving graphics rendering, user input handling, and data management.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
Brainstorming ideas for the 3D scene, including objects, interactions, and camera controls. Developing a basic version of the scene to test different aspects, such as rendering quality, performance, and user controls.
Polishing the design to meet the final project requirements and ensure a seamless experience.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Computational graphics and visualizations teach you how to represent data and ideas visually, making complex concepts easier to understand. These skills are valuable in fields like engineering, science, and design, where visual representation of data and simulations play a crucial role in learning and discovery.

How do I approach developing programs?
Start with a clear understanding of the requirements and create a development plan that outlines the steps, timelines, and resources needed.
Regularly test the code to catch and fix bugs early in the development process. This also includes unit testing, integration testing, and user testing.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Separating concerns by developing different parts of the scene (e.g., rendering, input handling) in distinct modules.
Applying matrix transformations for object manipulation and camera movement within the 3D space.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration played a crucial role by allowing you to continuously test and refine your 3D scene. Each iteration likely focused on improving specific aspects such as rendering quality, user interaction, or performance, leading to a more polished final product.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
As I progressed, I became more efficient in implementing features, debugging, and optimizing code.
Over time, you likely adopted more advanced techniques in graphics programming, such as efficient memory management and optimization of rendering pipelines.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides the foundational skills and knowledge to solve complex problems, develop innovative solutions, and create technology that can advance your personal and professional goals. Whether it's through programming, data analysis, or understanding algorithms, computer science equips you with the tools to succeed in a technology-driven world.
